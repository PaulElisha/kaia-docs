### üåê Content Translation

If you are fluent in a language other than English and want to contribute translations or improve the localized documentation, [submit an issue](https://github.com/kaiachain/kaia-docs/issues). Please use [labels](#Ô∏è-usage-of-labels) to specify your issue as `content-translation`.

You need to use the [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/kaia-docs) platform to contribute translations. For more information, see the [Internationalization](https://docs.kaia.io/misc/internationalization/) page.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For content translation, avoid using a pull request to submit changes by modifying the files under the [i18n](https://github.com/kaiachain/kaia-docs/tree/main/i18n) directory directly. </br> </br> Unlike other types of contribution, the translations are managed by Crowdin localization management platform. If a translation is submitted and has been approved in Crowdin, an automated PR will be made to Kaia docs repo. Once the PR is approved and merged by the project moderators, the localized Kaia docs will be updated with the suggested changes (merged content).

## ‚≠ê Contribution Best Practices

Here are some best practices to follow when contributing to Kaia Docs.

### üß∞ Content Creation Tools

We encourage the use of productivity tools to help create high-quality documentation:

#### ü§ñ AI-Assisted Writing

AI tools can help with drafting technical content, generating code examples, and improving documentation clarity. To learn how to effectively use these tools in your contribution workflow, refer to our [Contributing Documentation: AI-Assisted Writing Guide](https://github.com/kaiachain/kaia-docs/blob/main/.github/ai-writing-guide.md).

When using AI tools for content creation:

- Always review and verify the generated content for technical accuracy.
- Ensure all content follows our style and formatting guidelines.
- Maintain consistent terminology with existing documentation.

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Text Style Linters

Linting tools can help maintain consistent writing style and formatting across the documentation. Consider using tools like [Vale](https://vale.sh/) to ensure your content aligns with a writing guideline without consulting a style guide.

The Vale comes with several [pre-configured style guides](https://github.com/errata-ai/packages?tab=readme-ov-file#available-styles), including the Microsoft Writing Style Guide, Google Developer Documentation Style Guide, and more. It can be easily integrated into your text editor (e.g., VS Code) or CI/CD pipeline. You can also create a custom style guide to match the Kaia Docs [style guide](https://github.com/kaiachain/kaia-docs/blob/main/.github/style-guide.md).

### üí¨ Commit Messages

- **Start with a capitalized and imperative verb.**  
  Examples: "Update", "Fix", "Add", "Improve".

- **Use a consistent format for commit messages.**  
  A common pattern is `"verb: description of change"` (e.g., "Update contract addresses for Kaia chain").

- **Keep the subject line short and descriptive.**  
  It should clearly communicate the scope and focus of the change.

### üõ†Ô∏è Build and Dependencies

If your contribution involves adding new code or dependencies, ensure the project continues to build successfully after your changes by running a build command (for example, `npm run build`).

### üñºÔ∏è Image Processing

- **Keep all images optimized and compressed** to minimize file size (under 30KB whenever possible). This helps improve website loading speed and keeps the repository size manageable. Consider using tools like [Trimage](https://trimage.org/) to optimize your images.
- **Use rounded corners on screenshots** for a more professional look that improves focus on content and matches modern design standards. Consider using a free online tool (e.g. https://www.quickpicturetools.com/en/rounded_corners/) to add rounded corners to your screenshots.

## üìú Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Keep in mind when you submit your first pull request, you'll need to sign the CLA by posting the comment "I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA" in the PR. You will have to sign the CLA just one time, either as an individual or corporation.
